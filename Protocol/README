Since VMB is a TCP/IP based bus protocol, it is possible to do protocol
analysis of the VMB Ethernet traffic.

If all the VMB Components are located on the same Windows PC, one should
use Windows Message Analyzer.

If the VMB Components are spread on different PCs (Windows or other) and
connected on the same local network through a switch, then one can use
Wireshark with a LUA dissector. This directory provides such a dissector.
