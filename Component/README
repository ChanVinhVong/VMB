Any VMB Component must comply to the TCP/IP based VMB Protocol.

This allows modularity on the components:
 - a component can be coded in any language on any platform as long as
   its implementation can manage sockets,
 - a component can be easily replaced by another of its revision.

This directory provides sample implementations of VMB Components.
